msalibs
--------

A collection of C++ libraries / utilities primarily for openFrameworks. Using a lightweight wrapper which maps basic types (MSACore) some of them also work with Cinder (e.g. MSAFluid and MSAPhysics).

Each of these directories is a github repo in itself. The ofxMSALibs repo consists only of submodules to make checking out the whole thing simpler.
